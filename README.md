# Is a Twitch channel live or not?

Basic premise here was to build a quick minimal way to find out if a Twitch streamer is live and pull some simple data about them and the channel. I just wanted something easy to put on a friend's site, and couldn't find anything so I made this.

I'm acutely aware my JS skills aren't awesome; therefore if there are any **performance** or other **improvements** to be made by you genius JS devs.. feel free to [open an Issue](https://github.com/chuckreynolds/twitch-is-streamer-live/issues/new) or drop a Pull Request.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo and add the username you'd like to check to main.js.
2. You need a twitch account and a valid clientID. Get that from [Settings > Connections or just click here](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections) _(at the bottom)_. Add that to main.js too.
3. Additional info about the channel is displayed in the browser console.
