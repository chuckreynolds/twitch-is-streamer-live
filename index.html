		<p>Basic premise here was to build a quick minimal way to find out if a Twitch streamer is live and pull some simple data about them and the channel. I just wanted something easy to put on a friend's site, and couldn't find anything so I made this.</p>

		<p>I'm acutely aware my JS skills aren't awesome; therefore if there are any <strong>performance</strong> or other <strong>improvements</strong> to be made by you genious JS devs.. feel free to <a href="https://github.com/chuckreynolds/twitch-is-streamer-live/issues/new">open an Issue</a> or drop a Pull Request.</p>
